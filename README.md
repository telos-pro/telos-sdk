## ⬢ &nbsp;2 a.m. — where did all the money go?

2 a.m., agent still running. The counter in the bottom-right corner climbs to 2,847,103 — you convert it to dollars and your stomach drops. Worse: the line above reads `cache_read: 0`. All night long, every turn fed the same 4,000-token system prompt **from scratch** to the model, billed at full price.

Take the exact same **6-turn** real conversation, drop it into openclaw, flip two switches:

| Mode | raw input tokens | cache_read | Cost for 6 turns |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| passthrough (today's default) | 24,151 | 0 | **$0.3623** |
| with TELOS | 0 | 18,701 | **$0.0281 (−92.3%)** |

Scale to 1,000 sessions: **$362 → $26**. In a controlled A/B/C/D run (`showcase/dashboard.html`, 2026-05-19) — 48 calls across 4 sessions, counterfactual bill **$5.90**, actual **$3.74** — net saved **$2.16 (−36.6%)**. One dev machine, one afternoon. Multiply by team scale, and that's a real server invoice every month.

**Stop measuring in "X× fewer tokens."** In 2026, the pricing gap between tiers of the same model family already spans **80×–150×**. Anyone can inflate a ratio by stuffing the cheapest tier in the denominator — absolute dollars are the only number that doesn't lie.

## ⬢ &nbsp;3-step to save 90%

#### ❶ &nbsp;Install

```bash
pip install telos-sdk
```

#### ❷ &nbsp;Connect

```bash
telos init
```

Auto-detects **claude-code / codex / openclaw / hermes** on this machine, injects config into each, and starts the local gateway in the background (state written to `~/.telos/gateway.json`). No changes to your agent code.

#### ❸ &nbsp;Observe

```bash
telos dashboard
```

Opens an offline HTML dashboard in your browser showing savings per call in absolute dollars. Every invocation is automatically appended to `~/.telos/usage.jsonl` and aggregated in real time.

<p align="center">
  <img src="promo-assets/05-dashboard.png" alt="TELOS savings dashboard — absolute dollars broken down by harness / model / session" width="100%"/>
</p>

<p align="center"><sub><strong>Every saving pinned to an absolute dollar figure</strong> · No cloud server required · Opens offline · <code>~/.telos/usage.jsonl</code> fed directly into a single-file HTML page</sub></p>


**TELOS is open source. Run it on your own workflow — see whether that 92% is real, or just another "X× tokens" claim.**

## ⬢ &nbsp;Support Matrix

### Harness support

| Harness | Typical usage | `telos init` auto-connect | Status |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|
| Claude Code | Anthropic-native coding agent workflow | ✅ | 🟢 First-class |
| OpenClaw | Open-source agent runtime with TELOS parser integration | ✅ | 🟢 First-class |
| Hermes | Multi-agent orchestration with independent sub-IR handling | ✅ | 🟢 First-class |
| Codex | OpenAI-style coding workflow via local gateway injection | ✅ | 🟢 Supported |

### Frontier model support

| Model family | Provider | Through TELOS engine adapter | Notes |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| Claude (4.x / 4.6+) | Anthropic | ✅ | Explicit breakpoints and prewarm path |
| GPT (4+/5.x) | OpenAI | ✅ | Uses `prompt_cache_key` routing strategy |
| DeepSeek (V3+) | DeepSeek | ✅ | Deterministic byte-stable prefix behavior |

### Inference framework support

| Framework | Deployment style | Through TELOS | Cache-aware capabilities |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| vLLM | Self-hosted OpenAI-compatible serving | ✅ | Explicit anchors, prewarm, cache probe/evict, partial fork-and-replace |
| SGLang | Self-hosted high-throughput serving | ✅ | Explicit anchors, prewarm, cache probe/evict, full fork-and-replace |

<sub>Need another harness or model backend? TELOS is adapter-driven: keep the same IR and add an engine/harness adapter without rewriting your agent logic.</sub>

## ⬢ &nbsp;TELOS solves exactly two things

**① Push token efficiency to the limit.** 6-turn real session **−92.3%**; controlled 48-call run **−36.6% (net −$2.16)**. Every cent accounted for in absolute $/query-resolved — ratios can be faked; dollars can't.

**② Return context sovereignty to you.** `TelosIR` is an engine-agnostic, serializable, portable context representation. Your persona, your tools, your 20-turn mid-session thread — everything packed into the same **stone tablet**. Hand it to Claude today, move it to DeepSeek tomorrow, run it on a local vLLM tonight. **Your context; agents are just hired help.**

## ⬢ &nbsp;The protocol: not compression, but never breaking the prefix

Most agent frameworks treat KV-cache as a runtime gift the inference engine may or may not give you. TELOS inverts this:

> **Cache reuse is a structural property of the prompt itself, not a matter of runtime luck. If you never touch bytes already submitted, the cache *cannot* be invalidated.**

That principle materializes in three interlocking ideas.

### Three-color bands

<p align="center">
  <img src="promo-assets/03-banding.en.svg" alt="PIN / FOLD / DROP bands" width="100%"/>
</p>

Every content block declares its cache lifetime **at birth** — not post-hoc heuristics, not LLM guessing, but first-class structural annotation:

| Band | Color | Semantics | Cache behavior |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| **PIN** | 🟢 | Tool defs · system prompt · current question | Permanent. Never evicted. The immutable base of every request's prefix hash |
| **FOLD** | 🟡 | Conversation history · tool results · large docs | Cacheable, compactable. Under pressure, replaced by a summary — PIN prefix bytes stay untouched |
| **DROP** | 🔴 | Timestamps · CWD · git status · PIDs | Ephemeral. **Excluded entirely from the prefix hash.** Must follow all BPs; never contaminates upstream bytes |

The ordering invariant is absolute: **PIN\* → FOLD\* → DROP\*** — within each message, across the full prompt, at every layer. This is the **only** structural rule that wins the cache — everything else is implementation detail.

### Monotonic append

The prompt is an **append-only stream**. New turns only add blocks to the tail — **no mutation of already-submitted bytes**. A "modification" is expressed as a new block (summary, redaction), never an in-place rewrite.

<p align="center">
  <img src="promo-assets/04-append.en.svg" alt="Monotonic append: cache hit rate is monotonically non-decreasing with session length" width="100%"/>
</p>

Because earlier blocks are immutable and bytes are identical across turns, the inference engine's prefix-matching algorithm finds the longest common prefix on **every** request — not by luck, but by construction. **Cache hit rate is therefore a monotonically non-decreasing function of session length: longer sessions, more reuse, never regression.**

## ⬢ &nbsp;Roadmap

TELOS makes exactly one claim: **context is yours, agents are hired.** The current roadmap stays entirely within the *cost-saving gateway* narrative, with the seed of *trajectory as a portable asset* planted only in the last phase. **Anything that can be checked off goes on the roadmap; anything that can't, doesn't.**

| Phase | Thesis |
|---|---|
| **Phase 1** · Protocol correctness hardening | Turn "cache cannot be invalidated" from a slogan into a CI red/green light |
| **Phase 2** · Production reliability & observability | Make the gateway safe to leave on someone else's prod traffic |
| **Phase 3** · Take over the call chain | Go from prompt rewriter to the agent's traffic plane |
| **Phase 4** · Context becomes an asset | Trajectories are no longer logs — they're forkable code |

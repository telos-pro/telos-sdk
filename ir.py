"""TELOS IR: the one data structure passed between the three layers.

Design principles
-----------------
1. **Immutable** -- every dataclass is frozen; the bridge's "modify" actions return a new
   IR rather than mutating bytes on the original object. This way, even if an upstream agent
   sends the same IR to multiple bridges, there is no shared-state write race.
2. **Narrow fields** -- the fewer the fields, the harder they are to misuse. Any
   engine-specific knob is kept out of the IR; the engine adapter decides it at emit time.
3. **Three-color, all-or-nothing** -- every block must land in exactly one of
   ``pin / fold / drop``; there is no gray "both cacheable and non-cacheable" state.

Invariants (re-checked by the bridge before and after every primitive call, see ``bridge.py``)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**§5 order invariant**: within each segment (``tools`` / ``system`` / each ``message``),
blocks must be physically ordered ``pin* → fold* → drop*``. Exception: ``tool_result``
blocks in a ``message`` segment always come first (``tool_result* → pin* → fold* → drop*``)
-- Anthropic requires the tool_result of a user message to be physically first, and this hard
protocol constraint takes priority over band ordering. The ``tools`` / ``system`` segments
contain no tool_result and are unaffected.

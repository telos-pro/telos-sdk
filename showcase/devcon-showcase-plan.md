# TELOS · DevCon Showcase Plan

> **Audience**: Agent / LLM application developers (engineers building production Agents on Anthropic / OpenAI / DeepSeek / vLLM / SGLang)
> **Core value anchors**: (1) **Save dollars** — absolute-dollar savings from KV-cache (2) **Cross-vendor portability** — one IR runs on five engines
> **Format**: Main-stage Live Demo + Booth Hands-on area
> **Core take-away**: *Context is yours — not rented. Pin down what's stable so the cache actually hits you.*

## 0. One-Pager — Reading This Section Is Enough

| Dimension | Content |
|---|---|
| **Main tagline** | **`$0.36 → $0.03` · same conversation, 92.7% saved.** (Estimated against Claude Opus 4.7 list price; source `showcase/usage.jsonl`) |
| **Sub-tagline** | One IR, Five Engines. Stop being a tenant in someone else's agent. |
| **Booth key visual** | Three-color stele (PIN / FOLD / DROP) + live dollar-savings counter |
| **Recommended booth size** | ≥ 3m × 2m, fits 2 demo machines + 1 large display |
| **On-site staff** | 2 in rotation (1 presenter + 1 hands-on Q&A); add a 3rd at peak hours |
| **Core deliverables** | 5 showcases (A–E), 1 large-display dashboard, 1 one-page cheatsheet, 1 USB experience pack |
| **Offline fallback** | Every Live Demo runs fully offline (`telos showcase` ships with replay data) |

---

## 2. Showcase A · One IR, Five Engines

### 2.1 One Sentence

*The same OpenClaw request is parsed exactly once into a `TelosIR`, then fed unmodified to 5 engine adapters — Anthropic / OpenAI / DeepSeek / vLLM / SGLang. Capability differences are handled by **deterministic adapter downgrades** — not silent loss; the semantics are preserved.*

### 2.2 Goal

Convince the audience: **an Agent written on Anthropic today can move to self-hosted vLLM tomorrow without losing anything.**

### 2.3 Live Script (5 minutes)

| Timestamp | Screen | Talking point |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 | Open a terminal, black background, white text | "We're not building a prompt framework — we're building a portable protocol for Agent context." |
| 0:20 | Hit enter on `python -m telos.demo` | "One request, five engines, zero modifications." |
| 0:40 | Screen shows the `engine = anthropic` section, point at the BP slots | "Anthropic gets explicit breakpoints — all 4 BPs are used." |
| 1:30 | Flip to the `engine = openai` section | "OpenAI has no BP and **deterministically downgrades** to `prompt_cache_key` — the same IR automatically falls through to this capability." |
| 2:30 | Flip to the `engine = deepseek` section | "DeepSeek has neither — but the IR is still legal, the prefix is still byte-stable, and the cache still hits." |
| 3:20 | Flip to the `engine = vllm` / `sglang` section, point at `cache_policy` | "Self-hosted engines unlock more capabilities than closed-source APIs: probe / fold / cache hierarchy." |
| 4:00 | Highlight the `cooperative_fold` output | "On vLLM/SGLang the prefix KV is not recomputed — only the summary tail is. This is something closed-source APIs cannot do." |
| 4:40 | Wrap | "**Context is your asset, not something rented.**" |

### 2.4 Key Numbers

- **1 IR** → **5 engines** → **0 lines of prompt rewriting**
- Capability matrix (screenshot from README): BP / prewarm / routing_key / probe / fold — five rows by five columns

### 2.5 Risks & Fallbacks

- **Network risk**: demo.py is entirely local with no API calls ✅
- **Output-too-long blow-up**: bump terminal font to 18pt; pre-stage `python -m telos.demo > /tmp/demo.out` as a backup so you can scroll
- **Q&A prep**: R1–R8 (see §7), especially R1 (OpenAI quota) and R2 (mid-segment anchor)

---

## 3. Showcase B · `$0.36 → $0.03` Cash Counter

### 3.1 One Sentence

*The same 6-turn conversation, 4 switch combinations each run once — byte-identical request sequence, the only variable is the switch itself. `none` burns $0.36, `both` only costs $0.03. **The savings are in absolute dollars. Ratios can be gamed by shrinking the denominator; absolute dollars can't.***

### 3.2 Format

**Booth large display in loop + main-stage 3-minute lightning round**. Large-display content:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TELOS · Live Savings Counter                            │
│  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────     │
│  Mode    raw_in   cache_read   est. cost    saved        │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                  (numbers refresh every 30s from live replay)
```

### 3.3 Live Commands (3 minutes)

```bash
# Use the real-capture version (already included in showcase/replay_responses.json, marked source=real)
telos showcase --pace 1.5

# Or just keep it running at the booth (auto-loop):
while true; do telos showcase --pace 2 --quiet; sleep 30; done

# Or, more "engineer-flavored" — open the dashboard directly:
open showcase/dashboard.html
```

### 3.4 Pacing

| Timestamp | What to say |
|---|---|
| 0:00–0:30 | "How do we prove the savings? Not an estimate — record a real session, replay 4 times, byte-identical." |
| 0:30–1:30 | Screen scrolls through the 4-mode usage output, point at `cache_read` going from 0 up to 17,719 |
| 1:30–2:30 | Open dashboard.html; on the "saved $" board the four modes sit side-by-side; point at the $0.336 row |
| 2:30–3:00 | "Replay is a controlled experiment — CI-friendly, reproducible. Ratios can be gamed; absolute dollars cannot." |

### 3.5 Source of the Real Numbers (to head off skepticism)

The numbers come from `showcase/usage.jsonl`, an aggregation of values reported by Anthropic across 6 real-captured turns:

| Mode | raw_input | cache_read | Estimated $ ($15/M input + $1.5/M cache_read) |
|---|---|---|---|
| none | 24,151 | 0 | **$0.3623** |
| rtk | 22,841 | 0 | $0.3426 |
| telos | 0 | 18,701 | $0.0281 |
| both | 0 | 17,719 | **$0.0266** |

> Data comes from `showcase/usage.jsonl` (6 real-captured turns, aggregated by the mode field).
> **Saves $0.336 per 6-turn session · $336 per 1k sessions · -92.7%**. If you re-capture before rehearsal, remember to recompute this table.

> The narrator must call out: "Estimated against Anthropic's published list price; **actual billing may differ slightly**. The dashboard shows tokens, not dollars — the dollar figure is derived from public pricing × tokens."

### 3.6 Risks & Fallbacks

- **If asked "is this number real?"**: open `showcase/replay_responses.json` on the spot and point at `_meta.source = "real"`
- **If asked "why doesn't rtk alone save money?"**: rtk only compresses tool_result volume, it does not stabilize the prefix; the prefix is still recomputed every turn → see playbook §5
- **If the large display dies**: keep a PDF / single-file HTML backup, copy-able straight from a USB stick

---

## 4. Showcase C · Break the Stele (Hands-on Area)

### 4.1 One Sentence

*The stele has just one hard rule: within each segment, `PIN → FOLD → DROP`. Try it yourself — move FOLD before PIN and watch the protocol bite back.*

### 4.2 Format

**2 demo machines at the booth** (a MacBook Air is fine); each has a QR code + one-page cheatsheet on the side. Visitors walk up at will.

### 4.3 Primary Flow (5–10 minutes self-serve)

Guidance text (stuck on the side of the screen):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Try it in 3 minutes:                 │
│                                     │
│  (1) In the terminal: telos showcase --interactive
│  (2) Pick [3] — intentionally put FOLD before PIN
│      watch the protocol raise TelosInvariantError
│  (3) Pick [2] — change expected_turns (2/20/60)
│      watch the mark plan adapt
│  (4) Pick [4] — 4-mode replay A/B
│  (5) Pick [5] — generate and open the dashboard
│                                     │
│  Won't hang; fully offline.          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4.4 Key Talking Points for the Attendant (avg. 2 minutes per hands-on visitor)

- **Menu [3] is the most visceral**: the protocol has exactly one hard constraint; violations tell you precisely which block is wrong
- **Menu [2] demonstrates adaptivity**: at `expected_turns=2` the mark plan only places 2 anchors; at 60 it enables mid-segment rolling anchors (R2)
- **Menu [4] is the small-screen version of B**: the visitor sees the 4-mode numerical differences themselves

### 4.5 Materials Checklist

- [ ] 2 demo machines, repo already `pip install -e .`, offline-verified
- [ ] Cheatsheet stuck to the side of the screen (the box in 4.3)
- [ ] USB experience pack stacks on the table (containing repo zip + cheatsheet PDF + QR code to the video)
- [ ] QR codes: (1) GitHub repo (2) Quickstart docs (3) lead-capture entry
- [ ] Keep an asciinema cast `showcase/demo.cast` handy — plays on the demo machine even fully offline

### 4.6 KPIs

- Hands-on visitors: ≥ 30 / day
- Average dwell: ≥ 4 minutes
- Lead-capture rate: ≥ 25%

---

## 5. Showcase D · Claude Code 5-Minute Quick Integration

### 5.1 One Sentence

*Take an npm-globally installed Claude Code, **without changing a single line of code**, and within 5 minutes route it through the TELOS cache — then watch cache_read climb in real time on the dashboard.*

### 5.2 Goal

Turn "save money" from an abstract number into a "I can install this right now" actionable demo. The audience is people currently using Claude Code / Cursor / Gemini CLI.

### 5.3 Live Script (5 minutes)

| Timestamp | Command / Screen | Talking point |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 | Open two terminals | "Install on the left, watch the cache on the right." |
| 0:20 | `telos gateway start --usage-log ~/.telos/usage.jsonl` | "Start a reverse proxy on 127.0.0.1." |
| 0:50 | `telos init --agent claude-code` | "One command, patches the env field in `~/.claude/settings.json` — **does not touch the npm package; npm update won't lose the config.**" |
| 1:30 | `telos init --agent claude-code --status` | "Confirm status: enabled." |
| 2:00 | Left: `claude` starts a coding task (pre-recorded or live) | "Usage is completely unchanged." |
| 3:00 | Right: `jq -c '{call: .call_index, cache_read: .normalized.cache_read}' < ~/.telos/usage.jsonl` | "Watch cache_read climb line by line. From the 4th turn on, each turn hits 6000+ tokens." |
| 4:00 | Browser opens `http://127.0.0.1:7171/__telos/dashboard` | "Live dashboard — PIN/FOLD/DROP distribution at a glance." |
| 4:40 | `telos init --agent claude-code --uninstall` | "Can be cleanly uninstalled at any time, restoring the pre-install state exactly." |

### 5.4 Key Numbers (visible on stage)

- **Integration time**: ≤ 60 seconds (1 init command)
- **Footprint**: only the `env` field of `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **Reversibility**: `--uninstall` restores exactly

### 5.5 Risks & Fallbacks

- **No on-site network**: pre-record a 30-second video "claude runs 6 turns → cache_read climbs" and play it when offline
- **`claude` really needs to hit Anthropic**: use a cheap short prompt ("list the current directory"); billing is controlled
- **If asked "what if the proxy dies?"**: non-strict mode (default) automatically passes through; the agent is unaffected

---

## 6. Showcase E · Cooperative Fold (Advanced Track)

### 6.1 One Sentence

*With closed-source APIs, fold is a client-side rewrite, and the server has to re-prefill the entire segment every time; on vLLM/SGLang, `cooperative_fold` lets the server **keep the prefix KV in place** and only recompute the summary tail.*

### 6.2 Audience

vLLM / SGLang users, engineers working on inference infrastructure. Expect a smaller audience (30–50), but a precise one.

### 6.3 Live Script (3 minutes)

```bash
# In the terminal, run the vLLM / SGLang parts of demo.py
python -c "
from telos import Bridge, load_engine, load_harness
from telos.demo import RAW_REQUEST

ir = load_harness('openclaw').parse(RAW_REQUEST, session_id='fold-demo', engine='sglang', model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3', expected_turns=20)
b = Bridge(ir, load_engine('sglang'))

# 1) probe
probe = b.probe_cache()
print(f'probe → hit={probe.hit} cached={probe.cached_token_count} tier={probe.tier}')

# 2) cooperative_fold
ctrl = b.cooperative_fold(message_range=(1,3), summary='<prev turns folded>')
print(f'server-side cache_control fragment:')
import json; print(json.dumps(ctrl, indent=2))
"
```

### 6.4 Pacing

- **0:00** "Closed-source APIs let you do fold — but the server doesn't know you folded. On the next request, that prefix is brand-new to the server, and the KV is fully recomputed."
- **0:40** Screen: `probe_cache` output — "First see what the server-side cache already has, then decide how to change it."
- **1:30** Screen: `cooperative_fold` output; point at the `cache_policy`/`cache_control` fragment — "The client tells the server: leave the prefix alone, just fold this segment."
- **2:30** Wrap: "This is **bidirectional engine capability** — only self-hosted engines have it. **For self-hosted engines, TELOS is an upgrade, not a downgrade.**"

### 6.5 When to Run It

- Option 1: as an extension of A (after A finishes, invite interested attendees to the breakout room)
- Option 2: standalone slot on day 2 afternoon (inference engineers' track)

## 7. Q&A Prep · Protocol Risks R1–R8

> All already landed in `docs/showcase-runbook.md §5`. Each on-site presenter carries a printed copy.

| ID | Likely question | One-sentence answer | Code location |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Doesn't OpenAI `prompt_cache_key` only expand slots at ≥15 RPM? What about low traffic? | We set `KEY_RPM_SOFT_CAP=12` and auto-shard | `engine/openai.py` |
| R2 | Anthropic only has 4 BPs — how do you cover dozens of turns? | Mid-segment rolling anchors `_MID_ANCHOR_STRIDE=19`, adaptive | `engine/anthropic.py` |
| R3 | Child Agent and parent Agent share session_id — won't they cross-contaminate? | Child IR is parsed independently (hermes) | `harness/hermes.py` |
| R4 | What if a mark slot lands inside a folded region after fold? | `fold()` forces a re-run of `mark()` | `bridge.py` |
| R5 | Won't unstable tool-field ordering break the cache? | `_canonicalize_ir()` pins key/tool ordering | `bridge.py` |
| R6 | Does the thinking block get lost across non-tool_result calls? | Adapters have a `thinking_preserved_across_non_tool_result` flag | `engine/base.py` |
| R7 | When BP candidates exceed 4, who gets kept? | `plan_marks` priority + truncation | `engine/anthropic.py` |
| R8 | Could refresh end up maxing out the quota? | `REFRESH_THRESHOLD=11`, adaptive gating | `bridge.py` |

**The two most-asked questions whose answers are not in R1–R8:**

- **"Can replay measure end-to-end task cost?"** → No. Replay pins down the trajectory and measures "the cost of the same conversation under different encodings". For end-to-end measurement, use dual sessions (see `docs/replay-comparison.md §4`).
- **"Are the numbers real?"** → Open `showcase/replay_responses.json`; `_meta.source` is either `real` or `synthetic`. Today we're on `real`.

## 13.5 Reproducing the Numbers (type this when questioned)

```bash
cd telos-sdk
python3 - <<'PY'
import json, collections
agg = collections.defaultdict(lambda: {"cache_read":0,"raw_input":0,"calls":0})
for line in open("showcase/usage.jsonl"):
    r = json.loads(line); m = r["mode"]; n = r["normalized"]
    agg[m]["cache_read"] += n["cache_read"]; agg[m]["raw_input"] += n["raw_input"]; agg[m]["calls"] += 1
print(f"{'mode':6s} {'calls':>5s} {'raw_in':>8s} {'cache_read':>11s} {'est_USD':>10s}")
for m in ("none","rtk","telos","both"):
    v = agg[m]; est = (v["raw_input"]*15 + v["cache_read"]*1.5) / 1_000_000
    print(f"{m:6s} {v['calls']:>5d} {v['raw_input']:>8d} {v['cache_read']:>11d}  ${est:>8.4f}")
PY
```

Expected output:

```
mode   calls   raw_in  cache_read    est_USD
none       6    24151           0  $  0.3623
rtk        6    22841           0  $  0.3426
telos      6        0       18701  $  0.0281
both       6        0       17719  $  0.0266
```

Source-data validity: `head -c 200 showcase/replay_responses.json` should show `"_meta": {"source": "real", ...}`.
